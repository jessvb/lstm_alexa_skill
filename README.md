# lstm_alexa_skill
This project contains a Lambda skill for Amazon Alexa that returns words generated by an LSTM network. The LSTM network is run on MIT's CSAIL servers, and its source code be accessed in the [lstm_web_server repo](https://github.com/jessvb/lstm_web_server).

## usage
Before you can start your web server, you need to add the authentication key for MIT App Inventor’s redis server (for CloudDB) to the repo. First, navigate to your app in [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/) and check your project’s CloudDB component by clicking on it in the Components panel and looking at the Properties panel. You should see your authentication key under “Token”. Once you have the token, add it to the file named `tokens.js.template`, by replacing the string ‘insert_clouddb_token_here’ with your authentication key. 

In the same file, you also need to update your Amazon Alexa Skill ID, which can be found on the [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com). Replace the string ‘amzn1.ask.skill.XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXX’ with the skill ID for your respective Alexa Skill.

After that, copy and rename the `tokens.js.template` file to `tokens.js`:
```sh
cd lstm_alexa_skill
mv tokens.js.template tokens.js
```

You also need to obtain the required dependencies by using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as follows.
```sh
npm install
```
If running as an AWS Lambda function, then zip the contents of the `lstm_alexa_skill` folder and upload to the [AWS Management Console](http://aws.amazon.com/) as a Lambda function. For this particular skill, you should also make sure to increase the timeout (e.g., to 5 minutes) to provide sufficient time for the LSTM to generate text and send it back to the Lambda function.

Future versions of this `lstm_alexa_skill` repo will also describe how to run this function on a web server using `node.js`.
